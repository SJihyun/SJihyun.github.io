        Hi! I'm Jihyun and I'm from... a lot of places.
        I was born in South Korea, but I grew up in Argentina and now I live in United Kingdom. 
        I like to consider myself a citizen of the world.

    <p id="title">Finding My Way</p>
    <p id="text">
        I graduated from University as an Industrial designer but I could never find a job that I was passionate about.
        So I started doing some freelance photography which I still really enjoy. It gave me the chance to participate in some interesting projects and I even won some awards. It became one of my passions.
        A few years ago I got interested in web development first as a way to showcase my photography portfolio but then as I learned more I became more interested in it.
        However I was always a bit afraid of committing fully to web development and changing my whole career. Last year I even started working in the course pre-requisites but I didn't make it
        in time. So this year I decided I would finally do it and dedicated 100% of my time to finish all pre-requisites and get enough time to build my portfolio webpage the way I imagine it.
        I feel that my academic formation and my photography work already give me a strong base in design concepts. The idea about my webpage was to not only showcase what I've learned
        about web development but also to show you a fusion of my design and photography experience.
